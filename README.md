## Task 1 

### SimCLR 

### Random Augmentations 

The Random Augmentation Module (RAM) generates two random sequences of augmentations for each batch during training.

The candidate augmentations are as follows:

- Random rotation (0 to 180 degrees) with white fill
- Random crop followed by resize to original size
- Color jitter
- Gaussian blur with random kernel size

The following examples shows the original images $x$, $t_1(x)$ and $t_2(x)$ where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are randomly generated by the RAM:


### Projection Head

The projection head consists of *insert specs here*.
